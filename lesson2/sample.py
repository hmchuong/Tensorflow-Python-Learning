x = tf.constant(35, name='x')               # create a constant value called x, and give it the numerical value 35

In this step, a graph is created of the dependencies between the variables.
In this case, the variable y depends on the variable x, and that value is transformed by adding 5 to it.
Keep in mind that this value isnâ€™t computed until step 7, as up until then,
only equations and relations are computed.
